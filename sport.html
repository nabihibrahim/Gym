<h3>Sports documentaries</h3>
<h4>October 8, 2009 | Kenneth Turan</h4>
<p>Sports is more than the toy department of our culture, it's often the source of excellent documentary work. Case in point: "More Than a Game," which is destined to be known as "the LeBron James movie" but in truth is a whole lot more. It shows how the powerful bond that James formed with his teammates in high school and earlier sustained him and transformed everyone's lives. Also pay attention to a continuing series of involving documentaries, "30 for 30," sponsored by ESPN Films for the cable network and using big name directors.</p>
